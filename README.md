PyBank:

Analysis includes total months included in dataset, total net accrued, average change in Profit/Losses between months, greatest increase in profits (date & amount), and greatest decrease in losses (date & amount). Script prints the analysis to the users' terminal and exports a text file with the results.

The results include total votes cast, a complete list of candidates with corresponding vote-counts and percentages, and the winner of the election based on popular vote.
